This project is a for my class. I decided to my make it fitness related because fitness is my passion. I find when I'm making working on something that I'm passionate about I have an easier time at completing the task. Result of my passion for web development and fitness. I created this website to demonstrate my new found skills in HTML and CSS while also showcasing the offerings of a hypothetical gym.

##Features

Here's what you'll find in this project:
